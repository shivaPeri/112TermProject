Allows users to create custom 2d spirographs.
Also creates fast fourier transform (fft) animation of uploaded svg being drawn

A program in which users can make a custom drawing machine to create spirograph drawings. The machine can be customized in the following ways: wheel radius/speed, number of wheels, pen color/size, etc. The user can save and view drawings at various playback speeds. The user can also upload an svg file and watch the generated drawing machine draw the path of the svg.
